# Bodega Market Contracts (Beta)

## Overview

Bodega enables users to create and participate in prediction markets with ease, offering flexibility in payment tokens, a fee-sharing mechanism, and scalable infrastructure for global adoption.

## Features

1. **Create Your Own Market**  
   Users can deploy custom prediction markets for any topic they choose. Whether it's sports, politics, or events, Bodega provides the tools to tailor your market to your specific needs.

2. **Flexible Payment Options**  
   Bodega supports payments with **any type of token** on Cardano. Market creators can define their preferred token for participation, enhancing accessibility and broadening the user base.

3. **Fee Based on Volume**  
   - Fees are determined by the transaction volume within the market.  
   - These fees are shared between the **market creator** and the **protocol**, creating incentives for both participants and developers to drive activity.

## How It Works

### Market Creation  

Deploy a new market using the contract interface. Define the candidates, payment token, and resolution method.

### Participation

Users can join markets by contributing their tokens based on their predictions.

### Fee Sharing

- A portion of the transaction fees is allocated to the market creator.  
- The remaining fees go to the protocol to sustain and grow the Bodega ecosystem.

### Market Resolution  

Once the market conditions are met or the event concludes, the protocol handles payout distribution based on the outcomes.
